# Preston McIllece's Portfolio

My portfolio for showcasing my skills and projects that I've previously built. 

<h2> SpaceMath! </h2>

I've chosen to include SpaceMath! in my portfolio because this project gave me a glimpse into 
what working in the industry is like. For context, this project was structured to simulate a 
real world software engineering environment. On the first day of class, we were assigned groups,
assigned a project, and told that we would have three releases throughout the semester with the 
third release being our final product. This project was invaluable to me because I learned not only
how to work both individually and in a group setting but also several concepts and procedures that 
are commonly used in a software engineering setting. SpaceMath! was also valuable because I got to
experience connecting a frontend Actionscript application to a backend PHP/Flox application as well
as hosting our server on a Raspberry Pi.

<h2> Waste Management Project </h2>

Our Waste Management application that my group in CMPT 307 built has been chosen to include
in my portfolio because it was a project that really forced myself, as well as my entire group
to develop creative and effective problem solving skills. This application was built for the 
Environment Center of Westminster College so that they could better keep track of their waste 
data. The application consisted of a Java/Swing front end and an sqlite backend. This project was
the first time that I had built a project with a database as well as my first time building an
application of this size. Additionally, I was unfamiliar with the Swing framework as well as 
sqlite before the project which is why my problem solving skills developed so much from this
project. Lastly, I've chosen to include this project in my portfolio because I'm very proud
of how the application turned out. Our group worked very well together and I think that shows
in the final product.
