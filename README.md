# Preston McIllece's Portfolio

My portfolio for showcasing my skills and projects that I've previously built. 

<h2> FPLPredictions </h2>

I've included my senior capstone project in my portfolio because this is the most comprehensive, 
full-stack application that I've built. From hosting the application to a server and configuring 
the custom domain, to building a Lasso regression statistical model on the backend to working with 
Django on the frontend, I had to do it all for this project and I learned a great deal because of 
it. This project demonstrates my ability to critically solve problems, my knowledge of software 
design concepts, and my experience building a significant project individually. Be sure to check 
out the application at www.fplpredictions.com! This application was built using Python, the Django
framework, and the Fantasy Premier League's API.

<h2> SpaceMath! </h2>

I've chosen to include SpaceMath! in my portfolio because this project gave me a glimpse into 
what working in the industry is like. For context, this project was structured to simulate a 
real-world software engineering environment. On the first day of class, we were assigned teams,
assigned a project, and told that we would have three releases throughout the semester with the 
third release being our final product. This project was invaluable to me because I learned not only
how to work in a group setting but also several concepts and techniques that are commonly used in a 
software engineering setting. SpaceMath! was also valuable because I got to experience connecting a 
frontend Actionscript application to a backend PHP/Flox application as well as hosting our server on
a Raspberry Pi. This project also demonstrates my ability to communicate effectively whether it be 
through oral, visual, or written forms to help my team succeed. Due to the nature of this application
being a game for kids, I got to develop my creative skills as well and kind of run with
the ideas that were flowing.

<h2> Virtual memory manager </h2>

Virtual memory managers are a piece of the operating system that are responsible for translating and 
managing the correspondence between virtual - or logical - memory and physical memory. This program
fully implements a virtual memory manager including the TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer),
page table, backing store, as well as the logic to translate logical memory addresses to physical
memory addresses. This program demonstrates my system-level understanding of computers as well as
operating systems and memory allocation. I've also chosen to include this project as it shows my 
ability to pick up new, difficult ideas and implement them seamlessly. Lastly, this application shows my
knowledge of the C language. As with my all of these applications, this program also sharpened my critical 
thinking skills.

<h2> Chat server </h2>

For this project, we designed a transport layer protocol as a class and separately built chat clients
and servers indepently. As long as you were following the agreed upon protocol, these clients and servers 
could be written in any language or framework you chose and they would still be able to communicate. We 
chose to implement our chat client and server in Java as it has excellent classes for implementing threading.
This chat server is a perfect demonstration of my knowledge of threading and in particular, multithreaded 
applications. Additionally, I've included this application as I completed it with a partner which shows my
experience developing significant projects in a group setting. The collaboration between my partner and I 
on this project could not have been more seamless and we managed the project beautifully.

<h2> Waste management project </h2>

Our Waste Management application has been chosen to be included in my portfolio because it was 
a project that really forced myself, as well as my entire group to develop creative and effective
problem-solving skills. This application was built for the Environment Center of Westminster College 
so that they could better keep track of their waste data. The application consisted of a Java/Swing 
front end and a SQLite backend. This project was the first time that I had built a project with a
database as well as my first time building an application of this size. Additionally, I was unfamiliar
with the Swing framework as well as SQLite before the project which is why my problem-solving skills
developed so much from this project. Lastly, I've chosen to include this project in my portfolio
because I'm very proud of how the application turned out. Our group worked very well together and I 
think that shows in the final product.

<h2> Maze solver </h2>

The maze solver program is possibly the best example of my critical thinking skills and my ability
to solve problems. This program was implemented in Python and solves varying sized mazes using an 
A* (A-star) search algorithm. This particular program and really my Algorithms class as a whole
forced me to rethink how I was doing things to consider other, more optimal ways of solving problems.
I largely attribute my confidence as a software developer to this class and programs similar to this
one.

<h2> Personal impact project </h2>

My personal impact project was a part of my Climate Science and Consequences class and this project
helped to shape my global consciousness and responsibility. This project consisted of calculating
what your carbon footprint per year is and coming up with something simple you could do to reduce that
footprint. Once decided, you were to recalculate that carbon footprint with the change implemented. The
differing levels of emissions before and after were shocking. I'm very grateful that I had the opportunity 
to take this and to perform this project as it shaped the way I see the decisions I make on a day-to-day basis.
